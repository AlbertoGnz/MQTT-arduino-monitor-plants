# MQTT-arduino-monitor-plants
 Quick prototype with Arduino to send data over MQTT protocol. Testing for future project to monitor my garden.
 
It uses a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. Logic is processed on arduino. Arduino comunicates with ESP8266 modules via serial. ESP8266 is responsable for comunication via WiFi.

 
 Here you can find the prototype.
